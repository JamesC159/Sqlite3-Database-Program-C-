# Sqlite3-Database-Program-C-
simple, small C++ database program. For use of play/test purposes only. I will not be accepting changes to the repository.

If you want to execute this program sqlite3 database simulation program, clone to desktop. Place the files in a convenient location. If you are on a UNIX machine (Mac or Linux), simply enter the terminal, change directories to the current location of the files you have cloned (cd ~/your/file/path) and compile the program (g++ -o executable_name main.cpp Artist.cpp Track.cpp Cd.cpp -lsqlite3 -g). After compilation, enter ./executable_name as is. 

If the program does not compile and you wish to fix it yourself, make sure to have a debugger (GDB on Linux or LLDB on MAC). Type gdb executable_name or lldb exectuable_name in terminal. Google commands for debugging.

Sorry I did not provide Windows instruction, I am a UNIX man! :)
